							<p class="p-two">Encounters with embarrasment, guilt, self-consiousness, 
							remorse, etc. are an unavoidable part of everyday life, 
							and they sometimes have lessons to teach us--about our goals 
							and values, about the person we expect ourselves to be in 
							contrast to the prevailing cultural view of shame as uniformly 
							toxic influence. Shame is a book that approaches the subject 
							of shame as an entire family of emotions which share a painful 
						awareness of self. </p>
